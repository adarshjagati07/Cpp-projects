# Cpp-projects
This is a project completely written in Cpp language. I had implemented CRUD functionalities over here in which we can add, remove, delete and update Unit of measurements.

## About Project :
This project is divided into two folders or two directories one is dl(i.e., Data Layer) and another is bl(i.e., Business Layer)
In data layer i had implemented all the data management related stuff. i.e., All the crud operations are defined over here and in the Business Layer i have given the code such that no one can directly manipulate the data of data layer and after certain validation data layer code can be altered.

Data Layer as well as Business layer both are divided into four more directories. <br>
1.) include folder contains all the header files.<br>
2.) src folder contains the source code.<br>
3.) lib folder contains the library that we are going to provide to the client for further use of the project(or inside lib folder i had created the library of my project)<br>
4.) testcases folder contains the testcases to confirm our source code is working correctly or not <br>

Note: You can ignore those .exe files, those are created for runnable interface at my end. You can go with the source code

Soon i'll provide you with the commands such that you can run the same on your pc's too.
